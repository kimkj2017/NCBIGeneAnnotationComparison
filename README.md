## Intro

The main purpose of this website is to provide a gene comparison between cats (felis catus) and tigers (panthera tigris). Please provide either Gene ID, Gene Name, or both on the form in the main page if you wish to perform comparison.

We have used GFF files of cat and tiger, following NCBI format. You may download those files for reference.

## Instructions

The website is deployed in the either one of the following link.

* [Kwangju Kim](http://bio466-f15.csi.miamioh.edu/~kimk3)
* [Martin Heidelmen](http://bio466-f15.csi.miamioh.edu/~heidelmr)

You may also deploy on your own server with the HTML files. Please follow these instructions.

1. Place the source codes into the `/var/www/html` folder (needs `sudo` priviliges), or `/home/YourID/public_html` folder if you want to run the code.

2. If you have placed the source files in `/var/www/html`, you may simply type `http://YourDomain/`. If you have placed in `/home/YourId/public_html`, you must type `http://YourDomain/~YourID`. You do not have to explicitly write `index.php` or such. The package does not include `index.html`.

3. If your server doesn't have PHP installed, this package will not work accurately. We strongly encourage you, in this case applies to you, to refer to the following link to see the instructions.
